    <h1>Lesson 1: Familiarize yourself with basic HTML</h1>
    
    <h2>Get your tools ready</h2>
    
    <p>To follow this class, you need at least these tools:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        A text editor (<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> are both good options)
      </li>
      <li>
        Your preferred Browser
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Later on, we will learn about other tools, 
      like <a href="tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a>, 
      the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a> 
      and your preferred browsers developer support,
      so go ahead and have a look at them if you are interested.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Source</dt>
      <dd>The HTML document as displayed in your editor.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.1: Reading HTML</h2>
    
    <p>
      Have a look at this document itself, both in a browser and a text editor.
      Try to find out how each of the parts of the html documents gets displayed.
      Try to figure out their meaning.<br/>
      <strong>Bonus</strong>: Try to classify the elements in behavioural groups.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Turn all this into a small table<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>:
    </p>
    
    <table summary="Elements and their behaviour" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
      <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Groups</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;meta&gt;</td>
        <td>The meta tag allows you to describe meta information of the document</td>
        <td>only in head, not displayed</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>While doing that, answer the following questions:</p>
      
    <ol>
      <li>How do line breaks in the source display in the browser?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p id="footnote-1">[1] And reuse the spoilers we give you here.</p>
