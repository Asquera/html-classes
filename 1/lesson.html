    <h1>Lesson 1: Familiarize yourself with basic HTML</h1>
    
    <h2>Get your tools ready</h2>
    
    <p>To follow this class, you need at least these tools:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        A text editor (<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> are both good options)
      </li>
      <li>
        Your preferred Browser, we recommend Safari, Firefox and Google Chrome
      </li>
      <li>
        A Textbook to take notes and make little sketches of what you want to implement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="./coda.png" alt="Coda, editing this document."/>
    
    <p>Later on, we will learn about other tools 
      like the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a> 
      and your preferred browsers developer support,
      so go ahead and have a look at them if you are interested.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Source</dt>
      <dd>The HTML document as displayed in your text editor.</dd>
      <dt>Page</dt>
      <dd>The page displayed in the browser.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.1: Reading HTML</h2>
    
    <p>
      Have a look at this document itself, both in a browser and a text editor.
      Try to find out how each of the parts of the html documents gets displayed.
      Try to figure out their meaning.<br/>
      <strong>Bonus</strong>: Try to classify the elements in groups.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Turn all this into a small table<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>:
    </p>
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Groups</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;meta&gt;</td>
        <td>The meta tag allows you to describe meta information of the document.</td>
        <td>only in head, not displayed</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>While doing that, answer the following questions:</p>
      
    <ol>
      <li>How do line breaks in the source display in the browser?</li>
      <li>Try to find relationships between the tag names and their display properties.</li>
      <li>Most tag names are abbreviations. What is their meaning?</li>
      <li>What does the DOCTYPE statement mean and why is it important?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Exercise 1.2: Create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(text)#Boilerplate_code">Boilerplate</a></h2>
    
    <p>
      Create a small page that that serves as a starting point for the following exercises. Put
      it in a project folder and name it <span class="filename">boilerplate.html</span>. We will evolve this
      boilerplate with new stuff. Feel free to personalize it, as long as it doesn't keep you from getting started
      immediately.
    </p>
    
    <p>For now, your Boilerplate should contain:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The DOCTYPE statement</li>
      <li>A &lt;title&gt;-element</li>
      <li>A heading</li>
      <li>A paragraph</li>
      <li>Some kind of listing</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>It should also be correct. Check with the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>, if in doubt.</p>
    
    <p id="footnote-1">[1] And reuse the spoilers we give you here.</p>
