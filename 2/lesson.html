    <h1>HTML Versions</h1>
    
    <h2>A little history of HTML</h2>
    
    <h3>Early Standards</h3>
    <p>
      The first HTML specification was created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1990. Berners-Lee also wrote the first browser (mosaik) and 
      server software. HTML 2.0 was tge first standard published by the IETF in late 1995. Since then multiple version of the HTML 
      standard have been published. However, throughout its history, browser vendors extended HTML with their own specifications, often
      striving to outpace each other with incompatible extension. "Optimized for IE"-pages are one of the darkest chapters in HTML 
      history/
    </p>
    <h3>The Browser wars</h3>
    <p>
      Netscape was the first consumer-grade browser on the market and completely dominated the internet until Microsoft begun bundling
      Internet Explorer in Windows. This led to a fast adoption until Internet Explorer 6 became the de-facto standard on the web and
      Microsoft subsequently stopped browser development and innovation. While IE6 once was the leading browser in speed and technology
      it was then outpaced quickly, stopping its development gave other browser developers another chance. Opera developed a fast
      and respected niche-browser that up to today has it very loyal fan-base, Netscape tried to come back with Netscape 6 and failed.
      However, in a last daring move they open sourced the Netscape project and founded the Mozilla project which led to todays 
      Thunderbird mail-clients and the Firefox browser, one of the oldest and still strongest contenders to Internet explorer. Multiple
      other open-source browsers were created, most notably KHTML which evolved into the webkit rendering engine which today powers both
      google chrome and Apples safari.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today the browser market is fragmented and while increasing standards-compliance makes it easier to support multiple browsers,
      each project must decide which browsers should and will be supported up to which level. The situation gets worse with the rise of 
      mobile devices which ship their own browser versions.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="assignment">Browser Versions</h4>
    <p class="assignment">
      Research the current versions of the 5 mainstream browsers (IE, Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera). Look up Yahoos "Graded 
      Browser Support" and explain what it is.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Common HTML versions</h2>
    
    <p>
      While older versions are still in use in some places, HTML4 and XHTML1 are the most common HTML versions in use today. HTML5 is
      the version that enhances HTML by much needed functionalities while maintaining good backwards compatibility. New projects should
      probably use HTML5 unless there is a very compelling reason for another choice.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="assignment">Assignment:</h4>
    <p class="assignment">
      Make yourself familiar with the most common HTML versions. HTML4, XHTML1.0 and HTML5. Have a look at the strict and transitional
      variants where applicable. Make a list of the main differences.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Coding Style</h1>
    <p>
      A consistent coding style is vital for any project. It makes documents easier to read when you're working with other
      developers or when you're returning to your own project after a period of inactivity. A good coding style leads the eye and
      helps you grasp the documents structure at a single glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every developer prefers a slightly different coding standard and the exact standard used is of no real importance but the following
      rules should always apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you're joining a project, adopt the coding style used in the project. Make your work fit. A different coding style takes
        a while to pick up but you'll get used to it and soon it will suit you just as well as your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide on one way of indenting - tabs vs. spaces and how many spaces you'll use. There little that can throw you off as 
        badly as jumping indentions. This document uses soft tabs (spaces) with a 2-space indent for every level. This is a pretty
        common indenting, but others prefer real tabs or soft tabs with a 4-space indent. It is not important what you choose, but 
        whatever you do, don't mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if it's not strictly part of the coding standard, decide on a file system structure and a naming scheme for files in your
        project. Just as a good structure of layers in photoshop helps you organize and find elements of your design, a proper filesystem
        structure helps you organize and find your code. Sometimes the structure will be dictated by the framework you're using, but keep
        in mind that naming files is just as important.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide on a naming-scheme for classes and ids. Just like a proper color scheme, a good naming scheme supports you in guessing 
        what a class does when you encounter it in the code as well as remembering which class enables which functionality and it also 
        supports you in finding the proper name for a new class when you need one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide on whether or not you want to capitalize HTML-Tags. Both is valid in pure 
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr> and capital letters for 
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr> tags were <em>the</em> fashion some time ago.However, 
        <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr> requires lowercase tagnames and with its rise capital letter fell 
        out of fashion. HTML5 again allows both styles and so it's up to the developer to decide. Remember: It's not important which
        route you take, just stick with one. Since you might end up working with XHTML documents getting used to lowercase tagnames
        might be a wise choice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide which quotes you prefer. As with capital tags, XHTML requirements are stricter than HTML requirements. XHTML requires 
        double quotes while HTML4 and HTML5 allow both single and double quotes. As with the case of tagnames, using the stricter 
        requirement might be the wise choice, but most important: Don't mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your project may have different coding styles, for example one for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr>, one for 
        <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and one for Javascript.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="assignment">Assignment:</h4>
    <p class="assignment">Develop your own coding standard. Write it down and explain each decision.</p>
    
    <h1>Tags and attributes.</h1>
    <p>
      All HTML versions consist of a set of tags. Each tag has a name, carries a specific meaning and has some specific rules attached 
      to it. Some tags may or may not be nested within other tags, some tags are not allowed outside some other tags. All tags can carry 
      additional information in attributes. Some attributes such as <span class="code">class</span> and <span class="code">id</span> can 
      be added to all tags while other attributes such as <span class="code">href</span> can only be added to specific tags.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Structuring Documents</h1>
    <p>
      The structure of documents is the most important part. The document should both be readable to a human and to a machine even in 
      its raw form. When building an html document try not to think about how it should look like later. In the first iteration 
      structure the content. Add as much semantic information as you can and organize the content as you'd organize a proper layout. You
      can always add tags and make compromises later when you think about the styling. Work from the top, break content into chunks
      according to their function. Identify the main content of the page, any supporting information and elements such as navigations 
      and footers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Structural tags</h2>
    <p>
      There are multiple tags that help expressing structure. Most notably are perhaps headlines and paragraphs that outline the general
      document structure, but there's more such as ordered and unordered lists, definition lists and tables. One of the most important 
      tags is the the <abbr title="anchor" class="code">a</abbr>, often called "link" - even though there is a 
      <span class="code">link</span> tag. The anchor allows us to express connections within or even between multiple documents or 
      document sections. HTML was written to add semantic markup for documents. HTML5 capitalizes on this feature and adds a whole
      set of other tags that carry semantic information.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="assignment">Assignment</h>
    <p class="assignment">
      Compile a list of HTML4-tags that carry structural information as part of their semantics. Do the same for HTML5.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Using classes</h2>
    <p>
      Classes can be used to attach more specific information to tags. While the information given in classes is not as easily 
      accessible for machines as the semantic information in tags you should still keep in mind that classes can be used to encode
      semantic information. Microformats are an example for the usage of classes to transfer semantic information.
    </p>
